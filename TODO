# Ports TODO List

## Packages to bump:

 * gettext
 * git
 * make
 * mg
 * x stuff

## Packages to add:
 * clisp
 * dash
 * gnuchess
 * gnugo
 * go
 * irssi
 * linux-libre
 * spell
 * netcat
 * surf

## Misc:

 * Maybe switch to svc from r-36 (http://r-36.net/scm/svc/log.html) from busybox svc.
 * Comb through packages to find those that can be reasonably built without make.
